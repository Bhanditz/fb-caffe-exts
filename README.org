* =fb-caffe-exts=
=fb-caffe-exts= is a collection of extensions developed at FB while using Caffe
in (mainly) production scenarios.

** =predictor/=
A simple C++ library that wraps the common pattern of running a =caffe::Net= in
multiple threads while sharing weights. It also provides a slightly more
convenient usage API for the inference case.

#+BEGIN_SRC c++
  #include "caffe/predictor/Predictor.h"

  // In your setup phase
  predictor_ = Predictor::paths(FLAGS_prototxt_path,
        FLAGS_weights_path, FLAGS_optimization);

  // When calling in a worker thread
  static thread_local caffe::Blob<float> input_blob;
  input_blob.set_cpu_data(input_data); // avoid the copy.
  const auto& output_blobs = predictor_->forward({&input_blob});
  return output_blobs[FLAGS_output_layer_name];
#+END_SRC

Of note is the =predictor/Optimize.{h,cpp}=, which optimizes memory
usage by automatically reusing the intermediate activations when this is safe.
This reduces the amount of memory required for intermediate activations by
around 50% for AlexNet-style models, and around 75% for GoogLeNet-style
models.

We can plot each set of activations in the topological ordering of the network,
with a unique color for each reused activation buffer, with the height of the
blob proportional to the size of the buffer.

For example, in an AlexNet-like model, the allocation looks like
#+ATTR_HTML: :height 300px
[[./doc/caffenet.png]]

A corresponding allocation for GoogLeNet looks like
#+ATTR_HTML: :height 300px
[[./doc/googlenet.png]]


The idea is essentially linear scan register allocation. We

- compute a set of "live ranges" for each =caffe::SyncedMemory= (due to sharing,
  we can't do this at a =caffe::Blob= level)
- compute a set of live intervals, and schedule each =caffe::SyncedMemory= in a
  non-overlapping fashion onto each live interval
- allocate a canonical =caffe::SyncedMemory= buffer for each live interval
- Update the blob internal pointers to point to the canonical buffer

Depending on the model, the buffer reuse can also lead to some non-trivial
performance improvements at inference time.

To enable this just pass =Predictor::Optimization::MEMORY= to the =Predictor=
constructor.

=predictor/PooledPredictor{.h,cpp}= maintains a thread-pool with thread-local
instances of =caffe::Net=. Calls to =PooledPredictor::forward()= are added to a
=folly::MPMCQueue=, which are then dequeued by the thread-pool for processing.
Calls to =forward()= are non-blocking and return a =folly::Future= that will be
satisfied when the forward pass job finishes. =PooledPredictor= also supports
running multiple models over the same thread-pool. That is, if you load two
models, each thread in the thread-pool will maintain two instances of
=caffe::Net= (one for each model), and the =netId= param in =forward()=
specifies the model to run. =PinnedPooledPredictor= is an abstraction over
=PooledPredictor= when used with multiple models to pin the =forward()= calls
to a specific model.

#+BEGIN_SRC c++
  #include "caffe/predictor/PooledPredictor.h"

  // In your setup phase
  caffe::fb::PooledPredictor::Config config;
  config.numThreads_ = 10;
  config.optimization_ = caffe::fb::Predictor::Optimization::MEMORY;
  config.protoWeightPaths_.emplace_back(FLAGS_prototxt_path,
                                        FLAGS_weights_path);
  pooledPredictor_ = caffe::fb::PooledPredictor::makePredictor(config);

  // When calling predictor
  caffe::fb::PooledPredictor::OutputLayers output_blobs;
  pooledPredictor_->forward({&input_blob}, &output_blobs)
    .then([&] {
      const auto& output_blob = outputs_blobs[FLAGS_output_layer_name];
      // Do something with output_blob
    });

** =torch2caffe/=
A library for converting pre-trained Torch models to the equivalent Caffe models.

=torch_layers.lua= describes the set of layers that we can automatically
convert, and =test.lua= shows some examples of more complex models being
converted end to end.

For example, complex CNNs ([[http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842][GoogLeNet]], etc), deep LSTMs (created in [[https://github.com/torch/nngraph][nngraph]]),
models with tricky parallel/split connectivity structures ([[http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0398][Natural Language
Processing (almost) from Scratch]]), etc.

This can be invoked as

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ∴ th torch2caffe/torch2caffe.lua --help
  --input (default "") Input model file
  --preprocessing (default "") Preprocess the model
  --prototxt (default "") Output prototxt model file
  --caffemodel (default "") Output model weights file
  --format (default "lua") Format: lua | luathrift
  --input-tensor (default "") (Optional) Predefined input tensor
  --verify (default "") (Optional) Verify existing
  <input_dims...> (number) Input dimensions (e.g. 10N x 3C x 227H x 227W)

#+END_EXAMPLE


This works by

- (optionally) preprocessing the model provided in =--input=, (folding
  BatchNormalization layers into the preceding layer, etc),
- walking the Torch module graph of the model provide in =--input=,
- converting it to the equivalent Caffe module graph,
- copying the weights into the Caffe model,
- Running some test inputs (of size =input_dims...=) through both models and
  verifying the outputs are identical.
** =conversions/=
A simple CLI tool for running some simple Caffe network transformations.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ∴ python conversions.py vision --help
  Usage: conversions.py vision [OPTIONS]

  Options:
    --prototxt TEXT           [required]
    --caffemodel TEXT         [required]
    --output-prototxt TEXT    [required]
    --output-caffemodel TEXT  [required]
    --help                    Show this message and exit.
#+END_EXAMPLE

The main usage at the moment is automating the [[https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/examples/net_surgery.ipynb][Net Surgery]] notebook.


** Building and Installing
As you might expect, this library depends on an up-to-date [[http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/][BVLC Caffe]] installation.

The additional dependencies are

- The C++ libraries require [[https://github.com/facebook/folly][folly]].
- The Python =conversions= libraries requires [[http://click.pocoo.org/5/][click]].

You can drop the C++ components into an existing Caffe installation. We'll
update the repo with an example modification to an existing =Makefile.config=
and a =CMake= based solution.
